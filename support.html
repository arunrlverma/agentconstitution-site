<h2>Common Questions</h2>

<h3>How do I set up Agent Constitution with my AI agent?</h3>
<p>After installing Agent Constitution, the app displays a pairing code. Tell your AI agent the code — it will claim it and establish a secure channel. From there, your agent can make constitution checks before performing restricted actions. See the <a href="https://github.com/arunrlverma/relay4agents">GitHub docs</a> for integration details.</p>

<h3>How do I create rules?</h3>
<p>Open the app → Rules tab → tap "+" to add a rule. You can choose from 15 prebuilt templates across 6 categories (Communication, Financial, Social, Smart Home, Development, Data), or create custom rules using natural language descriptions. You can also use the AI suggestion feature — describe your boundaries and get rules generated for you.</p>

<h3>I'm not getting push notifications for approval requests</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure notifications are enabled for Agent Constitution in iOS Settings → Notifications</li>
  <li>Check that the app is paired (green status indicator on the dashboard)</li>
  <li>Verify your agent is sending constitution checks with the correct channel ID</li>
  <li>If your relay is self-hosted, verify it's running and accessible</li>
</ul>

<h3>I approved/denied a request but my agent didn't get the response</h3>
<p>Approval/denial responses expire after 60 seconds. Make sure your agent is polling for responses with the <code>wait</code> parameter. If you're self-hosting the relay, check that it's running and the agent's pull request is reaching it.</p>

<h3>How do I view my audit trail?</h3>
<p>Open the app → Audit Trail tab. You'll see a chronological list of every constitution check, including what action was requested, which rule was triggered, and whether you approved or denied. You can filter by category, date, or decision type.</p>

<h3>How do I remove my data?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rules:</strong> Open Agent Constitution → Rules tab → swipe to delete individual rules, or use "Reset All Rules" in Settings</li>
  <li><strong>Audit trail:</strong> Settings → Clear Audit Trail. This permanently deletes all logged decisions from the Keychain.</li>
  <li><strong>Relay data:</strong> There is none. The relay stores nothing to disk. Restarting the relay clears all in-memory data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Can I self-host the relay?</h3>
<p>Yes! The relay is open source. Clone the repo, run <code>npm install && npx tsx src/relay-node.ts</code>, or deploy to any cloud provider. See the <a href="https://github.com/arunrlverma/relay4agents">GitHub repo</a> for deployment instructions.</p>

<h3>Does Agent Constitution work with any AI agent?</h3>
<p>Yes — it's a pure HTTP API. Any agent framework that can make HTTP requests can perform constitution checks. We provide a ready-made skill for ClawdHub (<code>clawdhub install constitution</code>), but you can integrate with any agent by calling the API directly.</p>
